Find the Spy


This project uses a Markov Chain to solve the question proposed on the following site: https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2014.02.06/full/

The question is concerned with finding the long term likelihood of finding a spy in one South American country. The spy starts in an unknown location and must move to a new country each day. However, the spy can only move to a neighboring country.
